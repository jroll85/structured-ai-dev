\# LiveSales.us AI-Assisted Development: Compliance & Standards Alignment

Finally, it’s important to see how all these practices tie back to the compliance and security standards we adhere to. The table below summarizes how our AI-assisted development policy supports each relevant standard:

| Standard                   | AI Development Alignment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| \-------------------------- | \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| GDPR & CCPA (Data Privacy) | \- Data Minimization in Prompts: We never input real personal data into Cursor, preventing unauthorized processing of personal information. \<br/\>- Privacy Mode Enforcement: Cursor’s Privacy Mode ensures no personal data from code is stored or used in AI training, aligning with GDPR/CCPA requirements for data protection and purpose limitation. \<br/\>- Secure Code for User Rights: AI-generated code handling user data is reviewed for compliance (e.g., ensuring deletion functions truly erase data, respecting user consent flags). \<br/\>- No Personal Data Leakage: Our security prompts and reviews double-check that code doesn’t log or expose personal info inadvertently, upholding privacy by design.                                                                |

| SOC 2 (Security & Process) | \- Access Controls & Change Management: Only authorized team members use Cursor with company credentials; all AI changes go through human review and git tracking, providing an audit trail. This supports SOC 2 Change Management and Access Control requirements. \<br/\>- Confidentiality: Privacy Mode and careful prompt hygiene protect sensitive data (like code and secrets) from leaving the approved boundary. \<br/\>- Monitoring & Quality: Integrated scanning (Aikido, Sonar) and our checklists serve as continuous monitoring and mitigation of risks, aligning with SOC 2 Security principles. \<br/\>- Incident Response: If an AI introduces a vulnerability, our code review and testing process catches it (before merge), contributing to SOC 2 requirements to address deviations promptly. Also, Cursor’s SOC 2 Type II certification gives us third-party assurance of its controls. |

| PCI DSS (Payment Security) | \- No Card Data in AI: We strictly forbid entering credit card numbers or sensitive auth data into prompts or code. AI code dealing with payments is reviewed to ensure compliance (e.g., using tokenization, never logging card PAN or CVV). \<br/\>- Secure Payment Code Practices: AI is instructed to use PCI-compliant libraries/APIs for payments (for instance, using our payment gateway SDK which is PCI certified, rather than handling raw card data). Any AI output not following this is rejected. \<br/\>- Encryption & Key Management: If AI generates code for storing data, we ensure it uses encryption for sensitive fields as PCI requires. We prompt AI to use environment-stored encryption keys or our vault. \<br/\>- Least Privilege & Network Segmentation: While more of an architecture concern, any AI-suggested code changes that would violate our segmentation (e.g., sending card data to an unapproved service) are disallowed. Our oversight would catch and correct that. |

| FTC Endorsement Guidelines | \- No Fake AI Endorsements: We do not use Cursor (or any AI) to generate customer reviews or endorsements without proper disclosure. In code terms, any feature that surfaces testimonials or reviews is built to either use actual user-generated content or to clearly label AI-generated content as such, per FTC rules. Developers are reminded not to misuse AI to fabricate endorsements. \<br/\>- Disclosure in AI Outputs: If we ever employ AI to generate marketing copy or influencer-like content in our app, our code will include mechanisms for clear disclosure (e.g., a label “Virtual assistant” on an AI chatbot recommending products). The policy forbids releasing AI-generated promotional material that could mislead consumers without labeling. \<br/\>- AI Avatars Compliance: If LiveSales.us uses AI-driven avatars or virtual sales agents, the code and UX will follow FTC’s virtual influencer guidelines – ensuring they don’t masquerade as real unpaid users. This guide reminds devs to implement such features transparently (like an info tooltip “This is a virtual agent”) in line with FTC recommendations. \<br/\>- Monitoring & Moderation: While not directly code, if AI is used to personalize endorsements in-app, we would include checks (possibly AI moderation) to ensure compliance (no outrageous or unsubstantiated claims are made even by an AI agent). |

By following this guide, we ensure that our use of Cursor AI in development not only boosts productivity but also safeguards security, privacy, and compliance at every step. We combine the efficiency of AI with the prudence of strong engineering practices and oversight. The result is a development workflow that is modern and fast, yet meets the high-bar of quality and trust that LiveSales.us is committed to upholding.
