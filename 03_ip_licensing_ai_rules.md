\# LiveSales.us AI-Assisted Development: Intellectual Property (IP) & Licensing

When using AI-generated code, we must be vigilant about intellectual property rights and licensing. While code that AI produces may feel like “ours,” it could inadvertently be derived from training data that includes copyrighted or open-source code. Our policy is to treat AI suggestions as if they might contain third-party content until proven otherwise. We cannot include any code in our codebase that would violate licenses or copyrights.

\#\# Licensing Implications of AI Output

Be aware that AI models (like those powering Cursor) have been trained on countless public repositories. They might sometimes regurgitate snippets of code verbatim from those sources. This means an innocent-looking function could actually be a near-copy of someone’s GPL-licensed project code, which would impose strict license obligations on us if included. Or it might use an implementation that is fine, but adapted from a Stack Overflow answer (which carries a CC BY-SA license requiring attribution). It’s the developer’s responsibility to ensure we’re not introducing licensed code without compliance.

As a rule, prefer AI to generate code in a high-level, original way based on our prompts (which describe what we need) rather than copy-pasting known solutions. We explicitly instruct Cursor (via rules and prompt context) to \*avoid using any code that cannot be used freely in a proprietary project.\* If the AI provides a larger snippet that looks too polished or familiar, do a quick search – you can paste it into Google (or use GitHub’s code search) to see if it matches an existing source. If yes, either attribute it properly (if license allows) or ask the AI to “rewrite this in an original way” or simply use it as inspiration and write your own version.

\#\# No Copyrighted Material

Do not use AI to bypass copyright. For example, do not input proprietary code or copyrighted code you don’t own into Cursor hoping it will rephrase it – that could still be an infringement and is unethical. Likewise, if a product manager gives you an algorithm from a copyrighted source and asks to implement it, you must still follow the license on that algorithm – AI doesn’t magically clear rights. We ensure no verbatim copying from documentation or code unless it’s permissibly licensed (MIT, Apache, etc.) and even then we include attribution if required. For open-source components, it’s usually better to import the library than to have AI reproduce its internals.

One concrete measure: we maintain a log (in commit messages or comments) of where AI was used significantly in code contributions, as part of our “transparency trail.” This helps if questions arise about origin. While current law is evolving, it’s widely accepted that AI-generated code may not be copyrightable by the AI itself, but any \*human\* modifications or the selection/arrangement can be copyrightable by us. Regardless, we claim ownership of code we accept into our codebase, and we must ensure it doesn’t inadvertently include someone else’s protected work. The safest path is to thoroughly review and test AI contributions until you fully understand them – if you understand it, you can usually rewrite it in your own way, which helps avoid any direct copying concerns.

Also remember that \*our own\* codebase is proprietary; feeding large chunks of it into an external AI could expose our IP. With Cursor’s Privacy Mode and our enterprise settings, the risk is mitigated (no training on our code, and data not persisted). Still, share code context with the AI on a need-to-know basis. Do not dump entire proprietary files if not necessary; use the “Chat with codebase” to have Cursor access code securely rather than copy-pasting it externally. This prevents leakage and ensures compliance with SOC 2 confidentiality requirements.

\#\# IP & Licensing Do’s and Don’ts:

\* \*\*Do\*\* verify the provenance of significant code snippets generated by Cursor. If it’s more than a few lines of common boilerplate, run a search to see if it matches known published code. Small generic functions (like a basic sort or utility) are usually fine; but anything substantial that appears out-of-context (e.g., an entire encryption algorithm implementation) warrants a check.  
\* \*\*Do\*\* use AI primarily to generate original code in response to your prompts – provide enough spec so that the AI is creating code tailored to our needs (less chance it just recalls something). For example, instead of asking \*“Give me a function to generate an OAuth signature”\* (which might trigger a memorized solution), describe \*“Generate a function using HMAC-SHA256 to sign an OAuth 1.0 request. Use our existing crypto library interface.”\* The AI is then more likely to produce original integration code rather than a copied block.  
\* \*\*Do\*\* respect open-source licenses if AI output clearly incorporates them. If Cursor suggests using an open-source snippet (say from a blog under MIT License), include the attribution and license header as required, or better, use the official package. When in doubt, consult legal or a project lead.  
\* \*\*Do\*\* document where AI assistance was heavily used for new code (e.g., in the PR description, note “Used AI for initial draft”). This is part of our compliance and helps later if any IP questions arise. Transparency internally helps us audit and ensure no issues.  
\* \*\*Do\*\* enable any Cursor settings or plugins that help with license checks. (For instance, some AI tools offer a “safe completion” mode to avoid known big code fragments – ensure that’s on if available.)  
\* \*\*Don’t\*\* include code that you suspect is taken from a copyrighted source (especially if it’s unusual or domain-specific code that the AI would be unlikely to generate independently). If the AI outputs something with a copyright notice or oddly specific comments, do not use it.  
\* \*\*Don’t\*\* ignore license compliance for AI-suggested libraries. If Cursor recommends a library, check its license (e.g., GPL vs MIT). We cannot use GPL or AGPL code in a closed-source project like LiveSales.us without significant legal implications. If AI suggests such a library, find an alternative or confirm with the team before proceeding.  
\* \*\*Don’t\*\* use AI to generate content (code or otherwise) that violates any third-party patents or trade secrets. AI doesn’t know what might be patented – use your own judgment and company policy (e.g., avoid asking AI to reproduce an algorithm known to be patented).  
\* \*\*Don’t\*\* assume AI-generated code is free of attribution requirements. If the AI output includes even a part of a StackOverflow answer, legally we should credit it. It’s hard to tell, so the better approach is to either avoid verbatim use of such answers or proactively add a comment credit if you recognize it. Generally, aim to rewrite in our own style.  
\* \*\*Don’t\*\* share proprietary data structures or client data models in public AI forums. With Cursor, you’re within our environment, but if you ever use another AI tool for coding help, that could expose IP – our policy forbids that. Stick with Cursor (with privacy mode) for AI assistance on proprietary code, as it is SOC 2 Type II certified and designed with code privacy in mind.
